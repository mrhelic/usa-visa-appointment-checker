# USA Visa Appointment Checker

![Example Image](./visa-logo.jpg)

Hello, Visa Seeker!

This script automates the process of checking for available visa interview appointments. 

It logs into your account on https://ais.usvisa-info.com using your username and password, and then scans the appointment page for availability. 

You can run the script at regular intervals to receive timely alerts on new appointment slots. 

Optionally, you can configure it to send email notifications about appointment availability to you or someone else. 

Rest assured, the script runs locally on your computer, ensuring that your login details are not shared. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This code is designed for **Non-Immigrant Visa Applications** and has not been tested for Immigrant Visa applications. However, if you can read/write code, then it should be an easy problem to solve. If you give me a test account to write one, then I am happy to add that support as well.
